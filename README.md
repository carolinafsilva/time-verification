# Time Verification of Imperative Programs

## How to compile
```sh
dune build
```

### How to run
```sh
./main filename 
```

If your program has while-loops you will be requested for the following information for each of those whiles. 
* Invariant :: annot
* Variant :: aexp
* Number of iterations :: aexp
* Cost function of while :: lambda 

We provide some example programs that you can test for yourself.
